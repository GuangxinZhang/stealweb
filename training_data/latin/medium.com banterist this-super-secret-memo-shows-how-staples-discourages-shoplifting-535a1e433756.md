-   As the customer enters the store, make sure to greet them with a
    cheerful “Hello, welcome to Staples!” so that they feel welcome.
    Personally interacting with a customer reduces the chances of
    them shoplifting.
-   After the customer has walked 8 feet, have another employee welcome
    the person to Staples again. When a customer is greeted mere seconds
    after having been greeted, they are less likely to shoplift because
    they begin to worry they could be greeted again at any moment.
-   Once the customer has entered the store and begins shopping, have an
    employee introduce themselves to the customer and ask if they need
    help finding anything. If they say yes, lead them to the item
    they’re looking for. If they say no, wink at them and back away,
    using the “got my eyes on you” gesture.
-   Wait 40–60 seconds, then dispatch another employee from the opposite
    end of the aisle to approach the customer, introduce themselves, and
    ask if they need help finding anything. If they say yes, lead them
    to the item they’re looking for. If they say no, say “That’s funny.
    That’s *exactly* how shoplifters talk.”
-   Direct all floor employees to walk around, talking loudly about “all
    them ceiling cameras” and make sure they refer to “Big Jim, the
    See-Everything Man.” This will make any customer/potential
    shoplifter worry that they are being monitored.
-   Put on a spontaneous three-act morality play, where the
    protagonist’s casual theft of Gorilla Glue leads to his wife
    sleeping with Tad Norris, the jerk who bullied everyone in
    middle school. Customers are less likely to shoplift if they think
    it’ll make their wife a bully-banger.
-   If you see a customer holding any items, have an employee approach
    and ask them if they need assistance holding them “Just so’s they
    don’t magically wind up in your pants.” If the customer says no, the
    employee should point up to the heavens.
-   When a customer appears close to ending their visit, get one of the
    shelf stockers to feign a gruesome injury. Use red ink liberally for
    blood, since we get it wholesale. Ask the customer for help applying
    a tourniquet. Customers are less likely to shoplift from a store
    when they believe they’ve kept an employee from bleeding to death.
-   At check out, have cashiers ask “Did you find everything you were
    looking for?” as they point to the customer’s pants.
