On April 17, 2012, the Supreme Court [issued its
opinion](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6130306059465744559)
in *Caraco v. Novo Nordisk*, holding that “Congress has authorized a
generic company to challenge a \[brand manufacturer’s\] use code’s
accuracy by bringing a counterclaim against the brand manufacturer in a
patent infringement suit.”  In so holding, the Supreme Court reversed
a [Federal Circuit
ruling](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12665575272697438480) from
2010, which vacated an injunction of the lower court requiring the brand
manufacturer to change its use code at the FDA.  In that [lower court
ruling](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4229984110371523232),
the Eastern District of Michigan entered the following injunction:

> Novo Nordisk is hereby directed by mandatory injunction under 21
> U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(1)(bb) to correct within twenty (20) days
> from the date of this Order and Injunction its inaccurate description
> of the ‘358 patent by submitting to FDA an amended Form FDA 3542 that
> reinstates its former U-546 listing for Prandin and describes claim 4
> of the ‘358 patent in section 4.2b as covering the “use of repaglinide
> in combination with metformin to lower blood glucose.”

In light of the Supreme Court’s decision, Caraco on May 1 filed a motion
at the Federal Circuit, seeking to have the Eastern District of
Michigan’s injunction affirmed (text from the Federal Circuit’s docket):

Today, the Federal Circuit entered an order
\[[PDF](http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/10-1001%20order.pdf)\]
giving [Novo Nordisk](www.novonordisk.com/) until tomorrow to file its
response to [Caraco’s](www.caraco.com/) motion.  The full text of the
order reads:

> Novo Nordisk A/S *et al.* (Novo Nordisk) move for an extension of time
> to respond to Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. et al.
> (Caraco)’s motion to affirm the injunction of the United States
> District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Caraco opposes.
> Novo Nordisk replies.
>
> The court notes that on April 17, 2012, the Supreme Court of the
> United States in *Caraco Pharm. Lab., Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S*, 132
> S. Ct. 1670 (2012) reversed the judgment of this court and remanded
> the case for further proceedings.
>
> Upon consideration thereof,
>
> IT IS ORDERED THAT:
>
> (1) This court’s opinion of April 14, 2010 is vacated, the mandate of
> this court issued on August 5, 2010 is recalled, and the appeal is
> reinstated.
>
> (2) The motion is granted to the extent that Novo Nordisk’s response
> is due May 24, 2012.

Should be interesting to see what comes of this in the near future.
