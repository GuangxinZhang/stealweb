Rehearsals
==========

A few observations before doing the get-in, starting technical
rehearsals:

It hasn’t been ideal rehearsing without the writer being present,
especially with the 13 hour time difference between LA (where Gautam is)
and Bangalore.

Visits to NCBS to talk to scientists and to a local Primary Health
Centre were useful.

The ‘open rehearsal’ we did for some of the students who performed their
own AMR plays at Jagriti was interesting – we even got some laughs!

Discovering more about the AMR debate in India, and meetings  some of
those involved, has definitely fed-into rehearsals, at the very least to
confirm our main points of concern.

As director I’ve very much enjoyed working with a very talented bunch of
actors (not forgetting the stage-manager). This must be about the
twentieth Theatrescience project and they don’t get any easier. I
suppose balancing the ‘science’ with the ‘art’ will never be exactly
easy, but that, I suppose, is the point…
