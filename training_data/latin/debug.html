That’s not something that has made me feel that I can’t cope with it.”</p><p>He said he had held a “good discussion” with Li on Wednesday, when he informed him of his intention to resign, during which they did not discuss whether he should stay.</p><p><a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2067577/baptism-fire-hku-vice-chancellor-peter-mathiesons">A baptism by fire: HKU vice-chancellor Peter Mathieson’s term marked by political storms and mass protests</a></p><p>Mathieson rejected HKU student union leader Althea Suen Hiu-lam’s accusation of irresponsibility, denying that he had abandoned HKU’s students and staff. He said the university’s “superb” management team would continue its work, but he apologised for disappointing them by quitting.</p><p>“I don’t like the idea of leaving before the job is finished, and I don’t feel the job is finished here,” he said. “But I had to take into account the fact that this opportunity is available now ... and I had to make up my mind whether or not to take it.”</p><p>He said it had taken him months to come to the decision, during which he discussed the matter with his family and made two visits before and after Christmas to Edinburgh. He took leave from HKU and all expenses were paid by the University of Edinburgh, he added.</p><p>“When I walk around the streets of Edinburgh, I think of father and I think that my father would have been proud to see his son as the principal of the University of Edinburgh,” he said.</p><p>Mathieson will receive a substantially lower annual salary package of £301,000 (HK$3 million) at Edinburgh.</p><p>“Money is not the most important thing to me in the world,” he said. “The fact that there is a pay cut is irrelevant.”</p><p>The former dean of the University of Bristol’s medicine and dentistry faculty took the helm at HKU in April 2014, five months before the outbreak of the 79-day pro-democracy Occupy protests, which were led by students.</p></div></div></section></main>
