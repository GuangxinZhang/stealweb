Digging Through the Firmware</li>
</ul>

<p>In Parts 1 to 3 we’ve been gathering data within its context. We could sniff
the specific pieces of data we were interested in, or observe the resources
used by each process. On the other hand, they had some serious limitations;
we didn’t have access to ALL the data, and we had to deal with very minimal
tools… And what if we had not been able to find a serial port on the PCB?
What if we had but it didn’t use default credentials?</p>

<p>In this post we’re gonna get the data straight from the source, sacrificing
context in favour of absolute access. We’re gonna dump the data from the Flash
IC and decompress it so it’s usable. This method doesn’t require expensive
equipment and is independent of everything we’ve done until now. An external
Flash IC with a public datasheet is a reverser’s great ally.</p>

<h2 id="dumping-the-memory-contents">Dumping the Memory Contents</h2>

<p>As discussed in Part 3, we’ve got access to the datasheet for the Flash IC, so
there’s no need to reverse its pinout:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/54ih2LZ.jpg" alt="Flash Pic Annotated Pinout"></p>

<p>We also have its instruction set, so we can communicate with the IC using almost
any device capable of ‘speaking’ SPI.</p>

<p>We also know that powering up the router will cause the Ralink to start
communicating with the Flash IC, which would interfere with our own attempts to
read the data. We need to stop the communication between the Ralink and the
Flash IC, but the best way to do that depends on the design of the circuit we’re
working with.</p>

<h4 id="do-we-need-to-desolder-the-flash-ic-theory">Do We Need to Desolder The Flash IC? [Theory]</h4>

<p>The perfect way to avoid interference would be to simply desolder the Flash IC
so it’s completely isolated from the rest of the circuit. It gives us absolute
control and removes all possible sources of interference. Unfortunately, it also
requires additional equipment, experience and time, so let’s see if we can avoid
it.</p>

<p>The second option would be to find a way of keeping the Ralink inactive while
everything else around it stays in standby. Microcontrollers often have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Reset</code>
pin that will force them to shut down when pulled to <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>; they’re commonly used
to force IC reboots without interrupting power to the board. In this case we
don’t have access to the Ralink’s full datasheet (it’s probably distributed only
to customers and under NDA); the IC’s form factor and the complexity of the
circuit around it make for a very hard pinout to reverse, so let’s keep
thinking…</p>

<p>What about powering one IC up but not the other? We can try applying voltage
directly to the power pins of the Flash IC instead of powering up the whole
circuit. Injecting power into the PCB in a way it wasn’t designed for could
blow something up; we could reverse engineer the power circuit, but that’s
tedious work. This router is cheap and widely available, so I took the ‘fuck it’
approach. The voltage required, according to the
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/55c3hj349k8b8hj/Flash_S25FL064P.pdf?dl=0">datasheet</a>,
is 3V; I’m just gonna apply power directly to the Flash IC and see what happens.
It may power up the Ralink too, but it’s worth a try.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JBTsUfo.png" alt="Flash Powered UART Connected"></p>

<p>We start supplying power while observing the board and waiting for data from
the Ralink’s UART port. We can see some LEDs light up at the back of the PCB,
but there’s no data coming out of the UART port; the Ralink must not be running.
Even though the Ralink is off, its connection to the Flash IC may still interfere
with our traffic because of multiple design factors in both power circuit and the
silicon. It’s important to keep that possibility in mind in case we see anything
dodgy later on; if that was to happen we’d have to desolder the Flash IC (or just
its data pins) to physically disconnect it from everything else.</p>

<p>The LEDs and other static components can’t communicate with the Flash IC, so they
won’t be an issue as long as we can supply enough current for all of them.
I’m just gonna use a bench power supply, with plenty of current available for
everything. If you don’t have one you can try using the <em>Master</em>’s power lines,
or some USB power adapter if you need some more current. They’ll probably do
just fine.</p>

<p>Time to connect our SPI <em>Master</em>.</p>

<h3 id="connecting-to-the-flash-ic">Connecting to the Flash IC</h3>

<p>Now that we’ve confirmed there’s no need to desolder the Ralink we can connect
any device that <em>speaks</em> SPI and start reading memory contents block by block.
Any microcontroller will do, but a purpose-specific SPI-USB bridge will often
be much faster. In this case I’m gonna be using a board based on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">FT232H</code>,
which supports SPI among some other low level protocols.</p>

<p>We’ve got the pinout for both the Flash and my
<a href="http://www.xipiter.com/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/shikra_documentation.pdf">USB-SPI bridge</a>,
so let’s get everything connected.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SyUFtey.jpg" alt="Shikra and Power Connected to Flash"></p>

<p>Now that the hardware is ready it’s time to start pumping data out.</p>

<h3 id="dumping-the-data">Dumping the Data</h3>

<p>We need some software in our computer that can understand the USB-SPI bridge’s
traffic and replicate the memory contents as a binary file. Writing our own
wouldn’t be difficult, but there are programs out there that already support
lots of common Masters and Flash ICs. Let’s try the widely known and open source
<a href="https://www.flashrom.org/Flashrom">flashrom</a>.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">flashrom</code> is old and buggy, but it already supports both the <code class="highlighter-rouge">FT232H</code> as
Master and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">FL064PIF</code> as Slave. It gave me lots of trouble in both OSX and
an Ubuntu VM, but ended up working just fine on a Raspberry Pi (Raspbian):</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VzvjX31.png" alt="flashrom stdout"></p>

<p><strong>Success!</strong> We’ve got our memory dump, so we can ditch the hardware and start
preparing the data for analysis.</p>

<h2 id="splitting-the-binary">Splitting the Binary</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">file</code> command has been able to identify some data about the binary, but
that’s just because it starts with a header in a supported format. In a
0-knowledge scenario we’d use <a href="https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk">binwalk</a>
to take a first look at the binary file and find the data we’d like to extract.</p>

<p><em>Binwalk is a very useful tool for binary analysis created by the
awesome hackers at <a href="http://www.devttys0.com/">/dev/ttyS0</a>; you’ll certainly get
to know them if you’re into hardware hacking.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vdmjcDt.png" alt="binwalk spidump.bin"></p>

<p>In this case we’re not in a 0-knowledge scenario; we’ve been gathering data since
day 1, and we obtained a complete memory map of the Flash IC in Part 2. The
addresses mentioned in the debug message are confirmed by binwalk, and it makes
for much cleaner splitting of the binary, so let’s use it:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CX9raje.png" alt="Flash Memory Map From Part 2"></p>

<p>With the binary and the relevant addresses, it’s time to split the binary into
its 4 basic segments. <code class="highlighter-rouge">dd</code> takes its parameters in terms of block size (<code class="highlighter-rouge">bs</code>,
bytes), offset (<code class="highlighter-rouge">skip</code>, blocks) and size (<code class="highlighter-rouge">count</code>, blocks); all of them in
decimal. We can use a calculator or let the shell do the hex do decimal
conversions with <code class="highlighter-rouge">$(())</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ dd if=spidump.bin of=bootloader.bin bs=1 count=$((0x020000))
    131072+0 records in

    1703936 bytes transferred in 2.743594 secs (621060 bytes/sec)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We have created 4 different binary files:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">bootloader.bin</code>:
U-boot. The bootloader.
It’s not compressed because the Ralink wouldn’t know how to decompress it.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">mainkernel.bin</code>:
Linux Kernel. The basic firmware in charge of controlling the bare metal.
Compressed using <code class="highlighter-rouge">lzma</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">mainrootfs.bin</code>:
Filesystem. Contains all sorts of important binaries and configuration files.
Compressed as <code class="highlighter-rouge">squashfs</code> using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lzma</code> algorithm</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">protect.bin</code>:
Miscellaneous data as explained in Part 3.
Not compressed</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="extracting-the-data">Extracting the Data</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve split the binary into its 4 basic segments, let’s take a closer
look at each of them.</p>

<h4 id="bootloader">Bootloader</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iuFJjvG.png" alt="binwalk bootloader.bin"></p>

<p>Binwalk found the uImage header and decoded it for us. U-Boot uses these headers
to identify relevant memory areas. It’s the same info that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">file</code> command
displayed when we fed it the whole memory dump because it’s the first header in
the file.</p>

<p>We don’t care much for the bootloader’s contents in this case, so let’s ignore
it.</p>

<h4 id="kernel">Kernel</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XrusrH2.png" alt="binwalk mainkernel.bin"></p>

<p>Compression is something we have to deal with before we can make any use of the
data. binwalk has confirmed what we discovered in Part 2, the kernel
is compressed using <em>lzma</em>, a very popular compression algorithm in embedded
systems. A quick check with <code class="highlighter-rouge">strings mainkernel.bin | less</code> confirms there’s no
human readable data in the binary, as expected.</p>

<p>There are multiple tools that can decompress <em>lzma</em>, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">7z</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">xz</code>. None of those liked <code class="highlighter-rouge">mainkernel.bin</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ xz --decompress mainkernel.bin
xz: mainkernel.bin: File format not recognized
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The uImage header is probably messing with tools, so we’re gonna have to strip
it out. We know the <em>lzma</em> data starts at byte <code class="highlighter-rouge">0x40</code>, so let’s copy everything
but the first 64 bytes.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZY0CI10.png" alt="dd if=mainkernel of=noheader"></p>

<p>And when we try to decompress…</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ xz --decompress mainkernel_noheader.lzma
xz: mainkernel_noheader.lzma: Compressed data is corrupt
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">xz</code> has been able to recognize the file as <em>lzma</em>, but now it doesn’t like the
data itself. We’re trying to decompress the whole <code class="highlighter-rouge">mainkernel</code> Flash area, but
the stored data is extremely unlikely to be occupying 100% of the memory segment.
Let’s remove any unused memory from the tail of the binary and try again:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4pdQnpX.png" alt="Cut off the tail; decompression success"></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">xz</code> seems to have decompressed the data successfully. We can easily verify that
using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">strings</code> command, which finds ASCII strings in binary files. Since
we’re at it, we may as well look for something useful…</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nsWB75q.png" alt="strings kernel grep key"></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Wi-Fi Easy and Secure Key Derivation</code> string looks promising, but as it
turns out it’s just a hardcoded string defined by the
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fq1i4lkbnslang2/Wi-Fi%20Protected%20Setup%20Specification%201.0h.pdf">Wi-Fi Protected Setup spec</a>.
Nothing to do with the password generation algorithm we’re interested in.</p>

<p>We’ve proven the data has been properly decompressed, so let’s keep moving.</p>

<h4 id="filesystem">Filesystem</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/v8E2WxQ.png" alt="binwalk mainrootfs.bin"></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">mainrootfs</code> memory segment does <strong>not</strong> have a uImage header because it’s
relevant to the kernel but not to U-Boot.</p>

<p>SquashFS is a very common filesystem in embedded systems. There are multiple
versions and variations, and manufacturers sometimes use custom signatures to
make the data harder to locate inside the binary. We may have to fiddle with
multiple versions of <code class="highlighter-rouge">unsquashfs</code> and/or modify the signatures, so let me show
you what the signature looks like in this case:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GFaD38g.png" alt="sqsh signature in hexdump"></p>

<p>Since the filesystem is very common and finding the right configuration is
tedious work, somebody may have already written a script to automate the task.
I came across this
<a href="https://github.com/cinquemb/firmware-mod-kit-osx">OSX-specific fork</a>
of the
<a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/firmware-mod-kit/">Firmware Modification Kit</a>,
which compiles multiple versions of <code class="highlighter-rouge">unsquashfs</code> and includes a neat script
called <code class="highlighter-rouge">unsquashfs_all.sh</code> to run all of them. It’s worth a try.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sYi6PO6.png" alt="unsquashfs_all.sh mainrootfs.bin"></p>

<p>Wasn’t that easy? We got lucky with the SquashFS version and supported signature,
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">unsquashfs_all.sh</code> managed to decompress the filesystem. Now we’ve got
every binary in the filesystem, every symlink and configuration file, and
everything is nice and tidy:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MUyII7j.png" alt="tree unsquashed_filesystem"></p>

<p>In the complete
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Palantir555/5d66ccd4b084053396749f88ad96a37f">file tree</a>
we can see we’ve got every file in the system, (other than runtime files like
those in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/</code>, of course).</p>

<p>Using the intel we have been gathering on the firmware since day 1 we can start
looking for potentially interesting binaries:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/89GG8mJ.png" alt="grep -i -r '$INTEL' squashfs-root"></p>

<p>If we were looking for network/application vulnerabilities in the router, having
every binary and config file in the system would be massively useful.</p>

<h4 id="protected">Protected</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/t6bcd05.png" alt="binwalk protect.bin"></p>

<p>As we discussed in Part 3, this memory area is not compressed and contains all
pieces of data that need to survive across reboots but be different across
devices. <code class="highlighter-rouge">strings</code> seems like an appropriate tool for a quick overview of the
data:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bzPVpdy.png" alt="strings protect.bin"></p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/Palantir555/568f7168866ddada5f9759295284f1db">Everything in there</a>
seems to be just the <code class="highlighter-rouge">curcfg.xml</code> contents, some logs and those few isolated
strings in the picture. We already sniffed and analysed all of that data in Part
3, so there’s nothing else to discuss here.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>At this point all hardware reversing for the Ralink is complete and we’ve
collected everything there was to collect in ROM. Just think of what you may be
interested in and there has to be a way to find it. Imagine we wanted to control
the router through the UART debug port we found in Part 1, but when we try to
access the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ATP CLI</code> we can’t figure out the credentials. After dumping the
external Flash we’d be able to find the XML file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">protect</code> area, and
discover the credentials just like we did in Part 2
(<em>The Rambo Approach to Intel Gathering</em>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">admin:admin</code>).</p>

<p>If you couldn’t dump the memory IC for any reason, the <em>firmware upgrade</em> files
provided by the manufacturers will sometimes be complete memory segments;
the device simply overwrites the relevant flash areas using code previously
loaded to RAM. Downloading the file from the manufacturer would be the equivalent
of dumping those segments from flash, so we just need to decompress them.
They won’t have all the data, but it may be enough for your purposes.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve got the firmware we just need to think of anything we may be
interested in and start looking for it through the data. In the next post we’ll
dig a bit into different binaries and try to find more potentially useful data.</p>
