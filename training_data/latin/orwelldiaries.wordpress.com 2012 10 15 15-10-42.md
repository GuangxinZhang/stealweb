A little bit of India transplanted to England. For some weeks our
Marathi newsletters were translated and broadcast by a little man named
Kothari, completely spherical but quite intelligent and, so far as I
could judge, genuinely anti-Fascist. Suddenly one of the mysterious
bodies which control recruitment for the BBC (in this case I think MI5)
\[1\] got onto the fact that Kothari was or had been a Communist, active
in the students’ movement, and had been in jail, so the order came to
get rid of him. A youth named Jatha, working at India House and
politically OK, was engaged in his place. Translators in this language
are not easy to find and Indians who speak it as their native tongue
seem to tend to forget it while in England. After a few weeks my
assistant, Miss Chitale, came to me with great secrecy and confided that
the newsletters were still in fact being written by Kothari. Jatha,
though still able to read the language, was no longer equal to writing
it and Kothari was ghosting for him. No doubt the fee was being split
between them. We can’t find another competent translator, so Kothari is
to continue and we officially know nothing about it. Wherever Indians
are to be found, this kind of thing will be happening.

*\[1\] This is presumably a reference to the mysterious and unexplained
‘College’ to which Orwell refers from time to time.*
