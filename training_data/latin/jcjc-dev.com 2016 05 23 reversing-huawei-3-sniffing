<p>The best thing about hardware hacking is having full access to very bare metal,
and all the electrical signals that make the system work. With ingenuity and
access to the right equipment we should be able to obtain any data we want. From
simply sniffing traffic with a cheap logic analyser to using thousands of
dollars worth of equipment to obtain private keys by measuring the power
consumed by the device with enough precision (power analysis side channel
attack); if the physics make sense, it’s likely to work given the right
circumstances.</p>

<p>In this post I’d like to discuss traffic sniffing and how we can use it to gather
intel.</p>

<p>Traffic sniffing at a practical level is used all the time for all sorts of
purposes, from regular debugging during the delopment process to reversing the
interface of gaming controllers, etc. It’s definitely worth a post of its own,
even though this device can be reversed without it.</p>

<h2 id="data-flows-in-the-pcb">Data Flows In the PCB</h2>

<p>Data is useless within its static memory cells, it needs to be read, written
and passed around in order to be useful. A quick look at the board is enough to
deduce where the data is flowing through, based on IC placement and PCB traces:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JRgtMEM.jpg" alt="PCB With Data Flows and Some IC Names"></p>

<p>We’re not looking for hardware backdoors or anything buried too deep, so we’re
only gonna look into the SPI data flowing between the Ralink and its external
Flash.</p>

<p>Pretty much every IC in the market has a datasheet documenting all its technical
characteristics, from pinouts to power usage and communication protocols. There
are tons of public datasheets on google, so find the ones relevant to the traffic
you want to sniff:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wikidevi.com/files/Ralink/RT3352%20product%20brief.pdf">Ralink RT3352F product brief</a>:
Not a datasheet, but it’s got some useful data</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/55c3hj349k8b8hj/Flash_S25FL064P.pdf?dl=0">Spansion FL064PIF</a>:
64-Mbit SPI Flash Memory</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we’ve got pinouts, electrical characteristics, protocol details… Let’s
take a first look and extract the most relevant pieces of data.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-flash-ic">Understanding the Flash IC</h2>

<p>We know which data flow we’re interested: The SPI traffic between the Ralink IC
and Flash. Let’s get started; the first thing we need is to figure out how to
connect the logic analyser. In this case we’ve got the datasheet for the Flash
IC, so there’s no need to reverse engineer any pinouts:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/54ih2LZ.jpg" alt="Flash Pic Annotated Pinout"></p>

<p>Standard SPI communication uses 4 pins:</p>

<ol>
  <li>MISO (Master In Slave Out): <strong>Data</strong> line <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ralink&lt;-Flash</code></li>
  <li>MOSI (Master Out Slave In): <strong>Data</strong> line <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ralink-&gt;Flash</code></li>
  <li>SCK  (<strong>Clock</strong> Signal): Coordinates when to read the data lines</li>
  <li>CS#  (<strong>Chip Select</strong>): Enables the Flash IC when set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> so multiple of them
can share MISO/MOSI/SCK lines.</li>
</ol>

<p>We know the pinout, so let’s just connect a logic analyser to those 4 pins and
capture some random transmission:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TjSkKyN.jpg" alt="Connected Logic Analyser"></p>

<p>In order to set up our logic analyser we need to find out some SPI configuation
options, specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transmission endianness [Standard: <strong>MSB First</strong>]</li>
  <li>Number of bits per transfer [Standard: <strong>8</strong>]. <em>Will be obvious in the capture</em></li>
  <li>CPOL: Default state of the clock line while inactive [0 or 1]. <em>Will be obvious
in the capture</em></li>
  <li>CPHA: Clock edge that triggers the data read in the data lines [0=leading,
1=trailing]. <em>We’ll have to deduce this</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The datasheet explains that the flash IC understands only 2 combinations of
CPOL and CPHA: (CPOL=0, CPHA=0) or (CPOL=1, CPHA=1)</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Jut5DCs.png" alt="Datasheet SPI Settings"></p>

<p>Let’s take a first look at some sniffed data:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vaPgOc4.png" alt="Logic Screencap With CPOL/CPHA Annotated"></p>

<p>In order to understand exactly what’s happenning you’ll need the FL064PIF’s
instruction set, available in its datasheet:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EwOqG0x.jpg" alt="FL064PIF Instruction Set"></p>

<p>Now we can finally analyse the captured data:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IT1yDVu.png" alt="Logic Sample SPI Packet"></p>

<p>In the datasheet we can see that the FL064PIF has high-performance features for
read and write operations: Dual and Quad options that multiplex the data over
more lines to increase the transmission speed. From taking a few samples, it
doesn’t seem like the router uses these features much -if at all-, but it’s
important to keep the possibility in mind in case we see something odd in a
capture.</p>

<p>Transmission modes that require additional pins can be a problem if your logic
analyser is not powerful enough.</p>

<h2 id="the-importance-of-your-sampling-rate-theory">The Importance of Your Sampling Rate [Theory]</h2>

<p>A logic analyser is a conceptually simple device: It reads signal lines as
digital inputs every <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> microseconds for <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> seconds, and when it’s done it
sends the data to your computer to be analysed.</p>

<p>For the protocol analyser to generate accurate data it’s vital that we record
digital inputs faster than the device writes them. Otherwise the data will be
mangled by missing bits or deformed waveforms.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, your logic analyser’s maximum sampling rate depends on how
powerful/expensive it is and how many lines you need to sniff at a time.
High-speed interfaces with multiple data lines can be a problem if you don’t have
access to expensive equipment.</p>

<p>I recorded this data from the Ralink-Flash SPI bus using a low-end Saleae
analyser at its maximum sampling rate for this number of lines,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">24 MS/s</code>:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9wFGIj3.png" alt="Picture of Deformed Clock Signal"></p>

<p>As you can see, even though the clock signal has the 8 low to high transitions
required for each byte, the waveform is deformed.</p>

<p>Since the clock signal is used to coordinate when to read the data lines, this
kind of waveform deformation may cause data corruption even if we don’t drop any
bits (depending partly on the design of your logic analyser). There’s always
some wiggle room for read inaccuracies, and we don’t need 100% correct data at
this point, but it’s important to keep all error vectors in mind.</p>

<p>Let’s sniff the same bus using a higher performance logic analyser at
<code class="highlighter-rouge">100 MS/s</code>:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vVgxUa4.png" alt="High Sampling Rate SPI Sample Reading"></p>

<p>As you can see, this clock signal is perfectly regular when our Sampling Rate is
high enough.</p>

<p>If you see anything dodgy in your traffic capture, consider how much data you’re
willing to lose and whether you’re being limited by your equipment. If that’s
the case, either skip this Reversing vector or consider investing in a better
logic analyser.</p>

<h2 id="seeing-the-data-flow">Seeing the Data Flow</h2>

<p>We’re already familiar with the system thanks to the overview of the firmware
we did in Part 2, so we can think of some specific SPI transmissions that we may
be interested in sniffing. Simply connecting an oscilloscope to the MISO and MOSI
pins will help us figure out how to trigger those transmissions and yield some
other useful data.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uF6C4hN.jpg" alt="Scope and UART Connected"></p>

<p>Here’s a video (no audio) showing both the serial interface and the MISO/MOSI
signals while we manipulate the router:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJOCm0IIbPE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This is a great way of easily identifying processes or actions that trigger
flash read/write actions, and will help us find out when to start recording with
the logic analyser and for how long.</p>

<h2 id="analysing-spi-traffic---atps-save-command">Analysing SPI Traffic - ATP’s Save Command</h2>

<p>In Post 2 I mentioned ATP CLI has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">save</code> command that <em>stores something to
flash</em>; unfortunately, the help menu (<code class="highlighter-rouge">save ?</code>) won’t tell you what it’s doing
and the only output when you run it is a few dots that act as a progress bar.
Why don’t we find out by ourselves? Let’s make a plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wait until boot sequence is complete and the router is idle so there’s no
unexpected SPI traffic</li>
  <li>Start the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ATP Cli</code> as explained in Part 1</li>
  <li>Connect the oscilloscope to MISO/MOSI and run <code class="highlighter-rouge">save</code> to get a rough estimate
of how much time we need to capture data for</li>
  <li>Set a trigger in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">enable</code> line sniffed by the logic analyser so it starts
recording as soon as the flash IC is <em>selected</em></li>
  <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">save</code></li>
  <li>Analyse the captured data</li>
</ol>

<p>Steps 3 and 4 can be combined so you see the data flow in real time in the scope
<strong>while</strong> you see the charge bar for the logic analyser; that way you can make
sure you don’t miss any data. In order to comfortably connect both scope and
logic sniffer to the same pins, these test clips come in very handy:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cFYWhXd.jpg" alt="SOIC16 Test Clip Connected to Flash IC"></p>

<p>Once we’ve got the traffic we can take a first look at it:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HOu51lW.png" alt="Analysing Save Capture on Logic"></p>

<p>Let’s consider what sort of data could be extracted from this traffic dump that
might be useful to us. We’re working with a memory storage IC, so we can see the
data that is being read/written and the addresses where it belongs. I think we
can represent that data in a useful way by 2 means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Traffic map depicting which Flash areas are being written, read or erased in
chronological order</li>
  <li>Create binary files that replicate the memory blocks that were read/written,
preferably removing all the protocol rubbish that we sniffed along with them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Saleae’s SPI analyser will export the
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/udi77d5mbh6uele/capture_blog.csv">data as a CSV file</a>.
Ideally we’d
<a href="http://blog.saleae.com/using-the-sdk/">improve their protocol analyser</a>
to add the functionality we want, but that would be too much work for this
project. One of the great things about low level protocols like SPI is that
they’re usually very straightforward; I decided to write some python spaghetti
code to analyse the CSV file and extract the data we’re looking for:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Palantir555/4a902b40f6b5260e5cf0c75486d87c32">binmaker.py</a>
and
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Palantir555/b47ac1ffd878dc7106cedf7b845f4200">traffic_mapper.py</a></p>

<p>The workflow to analyse a capture is the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Export sniffed traffic as CSV</li>
  <li>Run the script:
    <ul>
      <li>Iterate through the CSV file</li>
      <li>Identify different commands by their index</li>
      <li>Recognise the command expressed by the first byte</li>
      <li>Process its arguments (addresses, etc.)</li>
      <li>Identify the read/write payload</li>
      <li>Convert ASCII representation of each payload byte to binary</li>
      <li>Write binary blocks to different files for MISO (read) and MOSI (write)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read the traffic map (regular text) and the binaries
(<code class="highlighter-rouge">hexdump -C output.bin | less</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>The scripts generate these results:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/Palantir555/4bf292e0e0237240627e85db9875ace6">Traffic Map</a></li>

</ul>

<p>The traffic map is much more useful when combined with the Flash memory map we
found in Part 2:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ODnxzJY.jpg" alt="Flash Memory Map From Part 2"></p>

<p>From the traffic map we can see the bulk of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">save</code> command’s traffic is
simple:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read about 64kB of data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">protect</code> area</li>
  <li>Overwrite the data we just read</li>
</ol>

<p>In the MISO binary we can see most of the read data was just tons of <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>s:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/73c7UKy.png" alt="Picture MISO Hexdump 0xff"></p>

<p>Most of the data in the MOSI binary is plaintext XML, and it looks exactly like
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/curcfg.xml</code> file we discovered in Part 2. As we discussed then, this
“current configuration” file contains tons of useful data, including the current
WiFi credentials.</p>

<p>It’s standard to keep <em>reserved</em> areas in flash; they’re mostly for
miscellaneous data that needs to survive across reboots and be configurable
by user, firmware or factory. It makes sense for a command called <code class="highlighter-rouge">save</code> to
write data to such area, it explains why the data is perfectly readable as
opposed to being compressed like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">filesystem</code>, and why we found the XML file
in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/</code> folder of the filesystem (it’s a folder for runtime files; data in
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">protect</code> area has to be loaded to memory separately from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">filesystem</code>).</p>

<h2 id="the-pot-of-gold-at-the-end-of-the-firmware-theory">The Pot of Gold at the End of the Firmware [Theory]</h2>

<p>During this whole process it’s useful to have some sort of target to keep you
digging in the same general direction.</p>

<p>Our target is an old one: the algorithm that generates the router’s default WiFi
password. If we get our hands on such algorithm and it happens to derive the
password from public information, any HG533 in the world with default WiFi
credentials would probably be vulnerable.</p>

<p>That exact security issue has been found countless times in the past, usually
deriving the password from public data like the Access Point’s MAC address or
its SSID.</p>

<p>That being said, not all routers are vulnerable, and I personally don’t expect
this one to be. The main reason behind targeting this specific vector is
that it’s caused by a recurrent problem in embedded engineering: The need for
a piece of data that is known by the firmware, unique to each device and known
by an external entity. From default WiFi passwords to device credentials for IoT
devices, this problem manifests in different ways all over the Industry.</p>

<p>Future posts will probably reference the different possibilities I’m about to
explain, so let me get all that theory out of the way now.</p>

<h3 id="the-sticker-problem">The Sticker Problem</h3>

<p>In this day and era, connecting to your router via ethernet so there’s no need
for default WiFi credentials is not an option, using a display to show a
randomly generated password would be too expensive, etc. etc. etc.
The most widely adopted solution for routers is to create a WiFi network using
default credentials, print those credentials on a sticker at the factory and
stick it to the back of the device.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ATznq7F.png" alt="Router Sticker - Annotated"></p>

<p>The WiFi password is the ‘unique piece of data’, and the computer printing the
stickers in the factory is the ‘external entity’. Both the firmware and the
computer need to know the default WiFi credentials, so the engineer needs to
decide how to coordinate them. Usually there are 2 options available:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The same algorithm is implemented in both the device and the computer, and its
input parameters are known to both of them</li>
  <li>A computer generates the credentials for each device and <strong>they’re stored
into each device separately</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Developer incompetence aside, the first approach is usually taken as a last
resort; if you can’t get your hardware manufacturer to flash unique data to each
device or can’t afford the increase in manufacturing cost.</p>

<p>The second approach is much better by design: We’re not trusting the hardware
with data sensitive enough to compromise every other device in the field. That
being said, the company may still decide to use an algorithm with predictable
outputs instead of completely random data; that would make the system as secure
as the weakest link between the algorithm -mathematically speaking-, the
confidentiality of their source code and the security of the computers/network
running it.</p>

<h2 id="sniffing-factory-reset">Sniffing Factory Reset</h2>

<p>So now that we’ve discussed our target, let’s gather some data about it. The
first thing we wanna figure out is which actions will kickstart the flow of
relevant data on the PCB. In this case there’s 1 particular action: Pressing
the Factory Reset button for 10s. This should replace the existing WiFi
credentials with the default ones, so the default creds will have to be
generated/read. If the key or the generation algorithm need to be retrieved from
Flash, we’ll see them in a traffic capture.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what we’re gonna do, and we’re gonna observe the UART interface,
the oscilloscope and the logic analyser during/after pressing the reset button.
The same process we followed for ATP’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">save</code> gives us these results:</p>

<p>UART output:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/u8ZMr4Q.png" alt="UART Factory Reset Debug Messages"></p>

<p>Traffic overview:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4xBapGf.png" alt="Logic Screencap Traffic Overview"></p>

<p>Output from our python scripts:</p>

</ul>

<p>The traffic map tells us the device first reads and overwrites 2 large chunks
of data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">protect</code> area and then reads a smaller chunk of data from the
filesystem (possibly part of the next process to execute):</p>

<p>Once again, we combine transmission map and binary files to gain some insight
into the system. In this case, the ‘factory reset’ code seems to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read <code class="highlighter-rouge">ATP_LOG</code> from Flash; it contains info such as remote router accesses or
factory resets. It ends with a large chunk of <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>s (<code class="highlighter-rouge">0xff</code>)</li>
  <li>Overwrite that memory segment with <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>s</li>
  <li>write a ‘new’ <code class="highlighter-rouge">ATP_LOG</code> followed by the “current configuration” <code class="highlighter-rouge">curcfg.xml</code>
file</li>
  <li>Read compressed (unintelligible to us) memory chunk from the filesystem</li>
</ol>

<p>The chunk from the filesystem is read AFTER writing the new password to Flash,
which doesn’t make sense for a password generation algorithm. That being said,
the algorithm may be already loaded into memory, so its absence in the SPI
traffic is not conclusive on whether or not it exists.</p>

<p>As part of the MOSI data we can see the new WiFi password be saved to Flash
inside the XML string:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jwyhjr2.png" alt="Found Current Password MOSI"></p>

<p>What about the default password being read? If we look in the MISO binary, it’s
nowhere to be seen. Either the Ralink is reading it using a different mode
(secure/dual/quad/?) or the credentials/algorithm are already loaded in RAM (no
need to read them from Flash again, since they can’t change). The later seems
more likely, so I’m not gonna bother updating my scripts to support different
read modes. We write down what we’ve found and we’ll get back to the default
credentials in the next part.</p>

<p>Since we’re at it, let’s take a look at the SPI traffic generated when setting
new WiFi credentials via HTTP: 
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Palantir555/8399b7b04f434612a25720201b537073">Map</a>,
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Palantir555/fc32335460c2f7b868dec41ab647f17c">MISO</a>,
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Palantir555/55623b098d26ccea8373fe9562368e23">MOSI</a>.
We can actually see the default credentials being read from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">protect</code> area
of Flash this time (not sure why the Ralink would load it to set a <strong>new</strong>
password; it’s probably incidental):</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0MFkiDc.png" alt="Default WiFi Creds In MISO Capture"></p>

<p>As you can see, they’re in plain text and separated from almost anything else
in Flash. This may very well mean there’s no password generation algorithm in
this device, but it is NOT conclusive. The developers could have decided to
generate the credentials only once (first boot?) and store them to flash in order
to limit the number of times the algorithm is accessed/executed, which helps hide
the binary that contains it. Otherwise we could just observe the running
processes in the router while we press the Factory Reset button and see which
ones spawn or start consuming more resources.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve got the code we need to create binary recreations of the traffic
and transmission maps, getting from a capture to binary files takes seconds. I
captured other transmissions such as the first few seconds of boot
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/Palantir555/1cabd9f6268286a4ab4092087f07241b">map</a>,
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Palantir555/9bc09495001fc003ed7d5a9fb23c2888">miso</a>),
but there wasn’t much worth discussing.
The ability to easily obtain such useful data will probably come in handy moving
forward, though.</p>

<p>In the next post we get the data straight from the source, communicating with
the Flash IC directly to dump its memory. We’ll deal with compression algorithms
for the extracted data, and we’ll keep piecing everything together.</p>

<p>Happy Hacking! :)</p>
