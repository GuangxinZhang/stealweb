How I went from zero experience to landing a 6-figure San Francisco design job in less than 12¬†months
=====================================================================================================

### **Act I: Tragic Backstory**

It was the summer of 2015 in the middle of nowhere. I was interning at
an agricultural company as an ergonomics consultant (read: filling out
fancy checklists).

I remember sitting at my desk at work browsing Facebook for the 8th time
that hour thinking, ‚ÄúOh great, more photos of my friends at exciting San
Francisco startups making four times my salary and drinking free beer at
work.‚Äù

*Me at my job. Excited for the boundless opportunities in¬†life.*
That evening when I was driving to the gym (because there was nothing
better to do in the literal middle of nowhere), I thought ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it
be awesome if there was an app I could use to meet other people?‚Äù

I‚Äôm not sure what possessed me at the time, but I was damn sure this was
a million dollar startup idea.

### **Act II: A Challenger Appears**

I called my idea ‚ÄúJoinmi‚Äù (meetup.com was a close second). It was a
mobile app that could plan meetups with friends & strangers (kind of
like SMS, Messenger, Whatsapp, but worse with less features).

All I needed now was a bunch of developers who would build this out for
equity (sorry if you cringed reading this).

To communicate my idea better, I scoured the web for a design tool to
accomplish my needs. I ended up using the free trial of
[Moqups](https://moqups.com/?gclid=Cj0KEQiAwrbEBRDqxqzMsrTGmogBEiQAeSE6ZejG1rCFFCQEcjLftzDvkTX8GNCl-U01ohRhWv6jif8aAsqM8P8HAQ)
to create a lit design.

*It was not ‚Äúlit.‚Äù Take note at how I expertly used the rewind button as
a replacement for the back¬†button.*
With my wireframes in hand, I spammed every developer I knew on my
contact list. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this great idea and these ‚Äúfire‚Äù designs, help
me build it out and we‚Äôll split the profits 50‚Äì50.‚Äù Yep, I was *that
guy*.

After lots of dead ends for some unknown reason, one of my friends
decided to humor me (üôè [Jay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaybamimore/)).
He said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good idea‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut I‚Äôd need more than just wireframes.
Create some mockups and I‚Äôll see what I can do.‚Äù

I looked up the best software to create mockups (after looking up what
they were) and ended up with a trial for
[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).

I didn‚Äôt know what user interface design was, so the concept of a
‚Äúmockup‚Äù was foreign to me at a time. I had to read a few embarrassingly
simple articles to understand the difference between a [sketch,
wireframe, and
mockup.](https://mobidev.biz/upload/blog/large_1402921794_sketch,_wireframe,_mockup.png)

Nonetheless, at around 4 to 6 hours per day, it took me the rest of the
remaining internship to create my first iteration of Joinmi.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*lbdxrl2xTDlSw2by.)
*This just proves that you don‚Äôt need talent to be a designer, or a
sense of colour for that¬†matter.*
### **Act III: The¬†Gamble**

Fast forward a bit to when my internship had ended and I‚Äôd moved back to
Waterloo to continue my education. I had put Joinmi on the backburner
after I figured out how much work it would be to launch a mobile app. At
this point in life I was a 3rd year college student studying an
unrelated major (Kinesiology) that I thought was my ‚Äúpassion.‚Äù I had
always planned go down this preset doctor path and fulfill the ‚ÄúAsian
parents‚Äô dreams.‚Äù

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*8OTxxQeWvNS6qRVl.)
What every Asian kid¬†knows‚Ä¶
One day, when I was browsing through the internship postings for my next
work term, I found several UX design internships available for my next
work term (much to my parents‚Äô displeasure). I remembered having fun
fiddling around in Sketch just a few weeks back, but also not being
remotely qualified for a real job. So I decided to just go for the
‚Äúsafe‚Äù jobs I had applied to in the past, thinking I wouldn‚Äôt have a
shot in tech.

Approximately 48 hours before the job application deadline closed, I had
another quarter-life crisis. At this time my girlfriend (S/O to [Carol
Yao](https://carol-yao.github.io/)‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägive her a dev job!) and another
close friend ([Jacky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackyyihanlu/)) urged
me to apply to those design internships regardless, since I had nothing
to lose.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Bmxwl8ZfLRm9zMJP.)
*I started to become slightly more proficient inside Sketch, you can
tell by the penguins.*
I thought back to the past few weeks, where I found myself choosing to
open Sketch instead of Steam and reading design articles instead of
Reddit. I decided to give it a shot.

Powered by a concoction of coffee, insomnia, and passion(?) I chose to
forgo 48 hours of sleep and put together a portfolio from scratch. I
just barely making the final internship deadlines.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*0ZK5jfiWbO97aRR_.)
*I‚Äôm pretty sure putting designs on 3D isometric mockups gives
recruiters the illusion of¬†skill.*
### Act IV: My First Big¬†Break

After waiting nervously for a few weeks, the stars aligned and I somehow
landed 9 design interviews. Spurred on with a newfound confidence, I
decided to skip my classes, drop my extracurriculars, and dedicate every
waking moment on interview preparations.

The main things I reviewed were:

-   The definition of user experience design
-   The design process
-   Common design principles and User Experience tools like personas and
    user flows

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0Qrhcfq1qFNnWpMnPi6jig.png)
*It was definitely the isometric 3D¬†mockups.*
Another thing I did that was very helpful was paying special attention
to every single piece of user interface I interacted with on a daily
basis. I focused on questioning their design decisions, and thinking of
potential ways to improve the gaps in user experience.

Without exaggeration, I read during class (when I bothered going), while
eating, on the toilet, and in bed until 2AM every night. I tried to
absorb as much as humanly possible to increase my chances.

> A little bit of obsession is part of the recipe for¬†success.

Of course, I was immediately rejected from most companies once they
found out I had 3 weeks of design experience. But something different
happened during my interview with Sony Network Entertainment.

I interviewed with Jesse, who would later go on to become my manager and
mentor. Unlike the other companies I‚Äôd interviewed at, he placed a much
higher emphasis on actual user experience, rather than visual design.

Despite most of my portfolio pieces looking terrible, he gave me the
internship based on how I answered his questions during the design
critique portion of the interview (I think). I also somehow managed to
pass the technical skills interview test by the skin of my teeth even
though I exaggerated about being ‚Äúproficient in Photoshop.‚Äù I was set to
start in a couple months, and I knew that I had to make this chance
count.

### Act V: Fighting Imposter¬†Syndrome

I spent the next few months continuing my hell-like grind, just reading
and designing even in my sleep (which I rarely got). The day I was
supposed to start, I was so nervous I circled around the block at least
10 times before I walked into the office. For the entire first month I
was jumpy and nervous, expecting to get fired at any moment the second I
was exposed as an imposter.

For the first week my main ‚Äúproject‚Äù was to design tabs for users to
compare channels on the PlayStation‚Ñ¢ Vue subscription site. Just the
tabs, nothing else. Yep, this here is what I accomplished in the first
week. One UI element. I even picked the colors myself.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*nHL9WbLGGXDXG9w8.)
*Fig 8. I was technically paid a week‚Äôs salary for¬†this.*
I felt like crap, and didn‚Äôt think I was making much of a contribution.
This motivated me to work harder, going above and beyond each project. I
was having doubts about breaking into the design field.

I talked to my mom and made a deal. I‚Äôd focus on design for an entire
year, and if I didn‚Äôt have any meaningful results by the end of it, I‚Äôd
quit and apply to chiropractic school the following year.

### Act VI: The¬†Grind

I lived my entire life without understanding what it meant to be
passionate. I had always assumed that passion was some inherently
magical fuel that successful people were just born with.

I thought I was ‚Äúpassionate‚Äù about biomechanics. As a regular person, my
definition of passion for the sciences was reading the occasional
scientific paper and finding a few classes somewhat interesting.

After being immersed in design for a little while, I found out that I
had been wrong all this time. Passion must be discovered. Passion is
when you **give up sleep, skip meals, and ignore your friends‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust to
fit a few more design hours into the day.**

There were more nights than I could count, where I‚Äôd think of an idea,
open up Sketch, and then within a blink of an eye hear my 8:00AM alarm
ringing.

I gave myself a pretty harsh schedule to adhere to. This is not
sustainable nor healthy. **Do not do this**:

-   Read 10 articles a day
-   Create at least 1 new user interface screen a day
-   Go to 1 hackathon every weekend
-   Work at least 10 hours each day
-   Take on every possible design opportunity available

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*zvrutOtouLdzPtD1LPwLCQ.png)
Probably the 10th iteration of Joinmi that I designed at Hack the 6ix,
my first hackathon
Some of the things I did that I felt were most useful include:

-   downloading Sketch UI kits (starting with native
    [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/resources/)
    &
    [Android](https://material.io/guidelines/resources/sticker-sheets-icons.html#sticker-sheets-icons-components))
    to re-create from scratch
-   re-creating mockups inside Sketch from popular app screenshots
-   critiquing commonly used apps like Yelp, Uber, Facebook, and coming
    up with alternative designs
-   examining design case studies like [user
    onboard](http://www.useronboard.com/onboarding-teardowns/)
-   the [100 Day UI Challenge](http://www.dailyui.co/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bOPFgT9ilMUCT_b_e2zREA.jpeg)
Post it notes make you look more¬†legit.
I also went through several online courses. Some of these are paid, but
I had a lot of spare money once I stopped going out:

-   [Udacity‚Äôs product design course by
    Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/product-design--ud509)
-   [Design + Code by Meng To](https://designcode.io/)
-   [Coursera‚Äôs Interaction Design
    Immersive](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/interaction-design)
-   [Interaction Design Foundation Design
    Courses](https://www.interaction-design.org/)

Just a small note on hackathons‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey are invaluable for a new
designer. Not only do they teach you how to work with other developers
(skills like specs, design communication)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou also end up with a
strong network of developer friends.

Having friends in the tech field will help open doors in the future. You
might even end up with a technical co-founder for your future venture
ideas!

> across the room like I did‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääuse Invision Inspect, Simpli, or other
> similar tools out¬†there.

### Act VII: A Stroke of¬†Luck

I guess my hard work was getting noticed around the office. My manager
started giving me larger projects, including a significant new feature
for the PlayStation‚Ñ¢ Video Android app. This was a relatively complex
project‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääprobably too complex for an intern at the time. So I
definitely had to go through quite a few iterations.

Each Sketch file got so large (over 300MB) that I had to create new ones
to avoid lag.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*I5bKtSSHChG9Z8K6AJzl5Q.png)
*Like this if you also name your Sketch files like I¬†do*
> To the design managers reading this: giving a promising intern
> ownership over a feature or project is a surefire way to double their
> productivity and job satisfaction.

After understanding the scope of the project, I felt a strong desire to
continue working at Sony. I talked with both my manager and the regional
director about extending my internship to 8 months, and it went through!

Just as I was getting into the groove of things, one day my manager
brought me into his office and informed me he was planning to leave.
Although things were a little bittersweet, I was blessed to have him
spend a considerable amount of time setting things up for me (even as
far as creating ‚ÄúRichard‚Äôs life plan.docx‚Äù for the next 12 weeks).

To put my situation in context, I was an unknown intern under my manager
in the Waterloo office. Most of the design team was based out of San
Francisco. My manager connected me with Alicia, the design lead for the
PlayStation‚Ñ¢ Video Web & Mobile team. She became my new mentor and
helped pave the way for the rest of my career at Sony.

Working as an isolated intern at the Waterloo office did have its perks.
My manager kindly shouldered all the meetings for me so that I had time
to focus on developing my design skills. But with this new development,
I knew there was an opportunity to become a more valuable asset to the
company.

This was a huge change of pace. I started getting over 50 emails every
day, attending triple the number of meetings, and juggling a lot more
administrative tasks. On the flip side, I gained a chance to develop my
communication skills, and learned how to work with a diverse team within
a bigger picture.

Design communication is hard. Defending your choices in front of a room
full of stakeholders is daunting‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially when you‚Äôre the most
junior person there.

> stuttered a million times and ended the meeting with my back drenched
> in¬†sweat.

### Act VIII: Getting the¬†Offer

By the time my 8 month internship ended, I had become a much more
integrated member of the design team. The design lead thought I was
doing some good work, so she introduced me to Reena, the senior design
manager for PlayStation‚Ñ¢ Video. Reena, was extremely helpful with making
me feel like I was part of the team, despite working remote from the
Waterloo office. When my internship officially ended, she helped me
secure a ‚Äúpart-time contractor‚Äù position while I was in school for the
next term.

During the day, I went to work in between my five classes, clocking
about 20 of work each week. One thing I did notice was that I could no
longer focus in class. Sitting through 10 minutes of lecture was like
pulling teeth.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*tUysvr4l3hw7M_eU.)
*You cannot possibly have a more unrelated design major than¬†mine*
Meanwhile things were going well at Sony. I put in my hours and got all
my jobs done. In the meantime I started several side projects, and had a
few consistent freelancing gigs.

I was certain that I wanted to become a designer, and nothing else. But
the one thing bugging me was whether I‚Äôd be able to secure a full-time
job upon graduation. I was nervous that having a unrelated major would
make me a much weaker applicant. I had a few discussions with the hiring
manager about joining the team full time, but there was nothing
concrete. Hearing that I was supposed to apply 4 to 6 months in advance
for a full time job made me anxious.

So I did the totally sensible thing and applied to 100 jobs in 1 weekend
(notice a trend here).

When applying to jobs, make sure to reach out to your network and snag
every referral possible. In my case though, for some reason, only one
out of the the 12 interviews I got came from a referral.

My interview process was not smooth sailing. Out of the 100 applications
I sent out, I was met with almost all rejections. One thing I did that
helped motivate me was print out all the rejections I got and nail them
to a wall as a reminder to work harder. This idea was inspired from
Stephen King‚Äôs philosophy in ‚Äú[On
Writing](https://www.amazon.ca/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816)‚Äù:

> ‚ÄúThe nail in my wall would no longer support the weight of the
> rejection slips impaled upon it. I replaced the nail with a spike and
> kept on writing.‚Äù- Stephen¬†King

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Sm90IscL-2t9s-rjntkdSg.png)
*Some of the rejection letters on my¬†‚Äúnail‚Äù*
Eventually‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääafter several interviews every week‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI got an offer from a
top tier Toronto startup for 85k base salary + stock options.

I was ecstatic. It was like a mountain had been lifted off my shoulders.
When I got into work the next day, I scheduled a call with my manager
and told her I was planning to take the job.

Literally. Got. A. Counter. Offer. In. 2. Days.

It was a hard decision choosing between the two, but ultimately I ended
up choosing Sony, as they had invested so much into me, and I loved the
team I worked with.

This didn‚Äôt necessarily apply to me, but I should mention that every new
grad‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääregardless of experience level‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääshould try and negotiate their
starting salary. The amount of resources a company has to expend to
narrow down a pool of applicants is huge. A company will not rescind an
offer if you start a negotiation. You have literally nothing to lose.

I could talk more, but Hasseb does a much [better
job](http://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/).

The moral of this story is, try and go above and beyond intern-level
tasks. Take an important role in high profile projects during your
internships. And have at least one solid offer in your back pocket
before discussing transitioning to a full time role.

If you‚Äôre just transitioning into design or any other field don‚Äôt have
the mentality that ‚Äúthis is pretty good for the ‚Äúx‚Äù amount of time I
spent learning,‚Äù instead you should be comparing yourself to the top
people in your field around your age.
