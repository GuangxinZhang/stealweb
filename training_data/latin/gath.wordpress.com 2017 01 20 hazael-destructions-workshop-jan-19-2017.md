[As mentioned
previously](https://gath.wordpress.com/2017/01/15/workshop-on-the-hazael-campaign-in-the-south-biu-thursday-jan-19th-2017/),
on Thursday, Jan. 19th, 2017, the first workshop of 2017 for of the
[RIAB Minerva Center](https://aramisrael.org/), was held at BIU, and the
topic was discussions of sites with possible remains of a Hazael-related
destruction, and sites of similar chronological/regional sequences. This
included papers on Tell es-Safi/Gath, Gezer, Tel Hamid, Aphek and
Jerusalem.

In the 2nd part of the day, a workshop in which pottery from Tell
es-Safi/Gath and Gezer were displayed and discussed.

One the things that clearly could be seen from the discussions is that
very distinct “micro-regionality” can be seen at sites from the 9th and
early 8th cent. BCE in the Shephelah, Philistia and the southern parts
of the Israelite (northern) Kingdom, and it may very well be that
pottery types that are often seen as indicative of this or that
chronological phase, may appear at earlier or later phases at different
sites. Similarly, sites which are very close to one another, have very
distinct differences in more or less the same chronological horizon.

What is clear from this day was that more research and joint discussions
and workshops are needed. We have to have additional ones in the future.

The lectures in the first part were filmed live, using “Facebook Live” –
which turns out is an excellent method to live stream an entire series
of lectures and discussions, for those who could not be at the workshop.

And here are some pictures from the pottery workshop, with discussions
on the Gezer and Tell es-Safi/Gath materials.
